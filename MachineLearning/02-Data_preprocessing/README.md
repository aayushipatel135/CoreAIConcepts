<h1> Data Preprocessing </h1>

Data preprocessing is the essential first step in machine learning, transforming raw, messy data into clean, structured input that models can use effectively. It addresses issues like missing values, noise, duplicates, and outliers while also preparing data for analysis through scaling, encoding, and feature engineering.

Key Steps in Data Preprocessing:
<ul>
  <li> Handling Missing Values: Replace or impute missing data for consistency. </li>
  <li> Filtering Noise: Remove irrelevant or erroneous data. </li>
  <li> Removing Duplicates: Avoid bias from repeated entries. </li>
  <li> Removing Outliers: Eliminate extreme values that skew results. </li>
  <li> Scaling: Standardize feature ranges for fair contribution. </li>
  <li> Encoding: Convert categorical data into numerical format. </li>
  <li> Feature Selection: Keep only relevant features to improve performance. </li>
  <li> Feature Construction: Create new, informative features. </li>
  <li> Data Augmentation: Expand datasets with modified samples, especially in images/text. </li>
</ul>

Advantages:
<ul>
<li> Improves accuracy and reliability of models. </li>
<li> Reduces bias, noise, and training time. </li>
<li> Enhances generalization and scalability. </li>
<li> Enables use of a wider range of algorithms. </li>
</ul>

Conclusion:
Data preprocessing is the backbone of machine learning. Investing time in this step ensures cleaner data, better predictions, and stronger models.
