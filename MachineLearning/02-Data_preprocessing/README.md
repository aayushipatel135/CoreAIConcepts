Data preprocessing is the essential step in machine learning where raw data is cleaned and transformed into a suitable format for modeling. Since real-world data is often messy—containing missing values, noise, inconsistencies, or irrelevant information—preprocessing helps improve the quality of the data and the performance of the machine learning model.

Common preprocessing tasks include handling missing data (e.g., filling or removing), scaling or normalizing features to a common range, encoding categorical variables into numbers, and removing outliers. Good preprocessing ensures that the data fed into the model is consistent, meaningful, and ready for training, which can greatly impact the accuracy and reliability of the results.
