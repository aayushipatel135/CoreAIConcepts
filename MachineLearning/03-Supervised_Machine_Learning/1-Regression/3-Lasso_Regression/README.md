<h1> Lasso Regression </h1>
  
Lasso regression is a regularization technique that helps prevent a model from overfitting, especially in datasets with many features. It adds a penalty term to the linear regression cost function, which is the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients multiplied by a tuning parameter, lambda (λ).

The key difference from other regularization methods like Ridge Regression is that Lasso can shrink some coefficients to exactly zero. This has the effect of completely removing those features from the model. This makes Lasso a powerful tool for feature selection, as it automatically identifies and discards irrelevant or less important variables, leading to a simpler and more interpretable model. Like Ridge, the optimal λ is chosen through cross-validation to balance the trade-off between bias and variance.
