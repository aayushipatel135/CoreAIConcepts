<h1> Ridge Regression </h1>
  
Ridge regression is a technique used in linear regression that's especially useful when a model suffers from multicollinearity, where predictor variables are highly correlated. This can make the model's coefficient estimates unstable and unreliable. To combat this, ridge regression adds a penalty to the standard linear regression cost function. This penalty, known as L2 regularization, is the sum of the squared coefficients multiplied by a tuning parameter, lambda (λ).

By adding this penalty, ridge regression forces the coefficients to shrink towards zero. While they won't ever reach exactly zero, this shrinkage makes the model more stable and less sensitive to small changes in the training data. This process introduces a small amount of bias into the model but significantly reduces its variance, leading to better performance on new, unseen data. The key is to find the right value of λ to balance this bias-variance trade-off, which is typically done using cross-validation.
