<h1> Linear Regression </h1>

Linear regression is one of the simplest and most widely used algorithms in supervised machine learning. It models the relationship between an input variable (or multiple input variables) and an output variable by fitting a straight line (in 2D) or a hyperplane (in higher dimensions) to the data. The goal is to find the line that best predicts the output (also called the dependent variable) based on the input (independent variable).

For example, in predicting a person’s weight, linear regression could be used to understand how factors like height influence it. The algorithm works by fitting a line through the data points and adjusting the slope and intercept to minimize the difference between actual and predicted weights. It’s simple to interpret and efficient to compute, making it an excellent starting point for regression tasks.
