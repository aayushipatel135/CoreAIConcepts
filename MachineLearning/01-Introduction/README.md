Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance on tasks without being explicitly programmed. Instead of following fixed rules, a machine learning model identifies patterns in data to make predictions or decisions, such as recognizing faces in photos, filtering spam emails, or recommending products online.

There are three main types of machine learning: supervised learning, where models learn from labeled data; unsupervised learning, where models find patterns in unlabeled data; and reinforcement learning, where models learn through trial and error by interacting with an environment. Machine learning powers many modern technologies, from voice assistants to self-driving cars.
