<h1> Introduction </h1>

Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that allows computers to learn from data and improve over time without explicit programming. Instead of relying on predefined rules, machine learning algorithms recognize patterns in data and make predictions or decisions, such as identifying faces in photos, sorting spam emails, or suggesting products based on past behavior.

Machine learning is typically divided into three main categories: supervised learning, where models are trained on labeled data; unsupervised learning, where models detect patterns in unlabeled data; and reinforcement learning, where models learn by interacting with their environment and adjusting based on feedback. These techniques power a wide range of technologies, from virtual assistants to autonomous vehicles.

The process of machine learning involves several key steps, including data collection, preparation, model selection, training, evaluation, and deployment. Here's an overview of how the process unfolds:
