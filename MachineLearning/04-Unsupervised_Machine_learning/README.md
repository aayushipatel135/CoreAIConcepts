Unsupervised machine learning involves training a model on data without labeled outputs. Instead of learning from examples with known answers, the model tries to find hidden patterns, groupings, or structures within the data itself. This approach is useful for tasks like clustering customers by behavior, detecting anomalies in financial transactions, or compressing data through dimensionality reduction.

Since there are no predefined labels, unsupervised learning is more exploratory in nature. Algorithms like K-means clustering or Principal Component Analysis (PCA) help uncover natural groupings or relationships in the data. It's especially valuable when labeled data is unavailable or too expensive to obtain.
