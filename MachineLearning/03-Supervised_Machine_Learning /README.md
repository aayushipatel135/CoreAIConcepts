Supervised machine learning is a type of machine learning where a model is trained on a labeled datasetâ€”that is, data that includes both input features and the correct output (also called labels). The goal is for the model to learn the relationship between the inputs and outputs so it can accurately predict the output for new, unseen data. Common applications include spam email detection, image classification, and predicting house prices.

In supervised learning, the training process involves feeding the model many examples, such as images of animals with their correct labels (e.g., "cat" or "dog"). The model adjusts itself to minimize errors between its predictions and the actual labels. Once trained, it can generalize to make predictions on new data with similar patterns.
