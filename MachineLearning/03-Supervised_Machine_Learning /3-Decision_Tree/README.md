A Decision Tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by splitting the data into subsets based on the value of input features, creating a tree-like model of decisions. Each internal node represents a feature, each branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents an outcome or prediction.

Decision trees are popular because they are easy to understand and interpret, even for non-experts. They mimic human decision-making and can handle both numerical and categorical data. However, basic decision trees can easily overfit the training data, which means they may perform poorly on new data. To improve performance, techniques like pruning, random forests, or boosting are often used.
