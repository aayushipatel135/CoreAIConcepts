<h1> Support Vector Machine (SVM) </h1>
  
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks, but it's most commonly used for classification. The main idea behind SVM is to find the optimal boundary (called a hyperplane) that separates data points of different classes with the maximum marginâ€”meaning the greatest possible distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points from each class (called support vectors).

SVM works well in high-dimensional spaces and is effective even when the data is not linearly separable, thanks to the use of kernel functions. Kernels (like polynomial or radial basis function (RBF)) transform the data into higher dimensions where a linear separator can be found. SVM is known for its accuracy and robustness, especially in complex or smaller datasets, but it can be computationally intensive with very large datasets.
