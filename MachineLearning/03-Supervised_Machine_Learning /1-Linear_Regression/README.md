Linear regression is one of the simplest and most widely used algorithms in supervised machine learning. It models the relationship between an input variable (or multiple input variables) and an output variable by fitting a straight line (in 2D) or a hyperplane (in higher dimensions) to the data. The goal is to find the line that best predicts the output (also called the dependent variable) based on the input (independent variable).

For example, in predicting house prices, linear regression could be used to find how factors like size, number of bedrooms, and location influence the price. The algorithm tries to minimize the difference between the actual and predicted values by adjusting the slope and intercept of the line. Itâ€™s easy to interpret and fast to compute, making it a great starting point for regression problems.
